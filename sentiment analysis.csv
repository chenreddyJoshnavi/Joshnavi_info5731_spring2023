18,Don‚Äôt trust Tech Exchange!,Don‚Äôt trust the refurbished phone from Tech Exchange!! The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word.  Then today when trying to make a phone call with the speakerphone every time I pushed one of the numbers to dial in the number from the pack and made a really loud high-pitched tone. When  I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I‚Äôve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.,dont trust refurbish phone teach exchang ear speaker phone work turn phone speaker phone make phone call tri take speakerphon hear marbl voic lot static understand everi with word today tri make phone call speakerphon everi time push one number dial number pack made realli loud highpitch tone hit side button tri shut sound screen went black still make weird highpitch sound end stop 3045 second annoy final shut phone complet turn back point abl make call speakerphon give never problem like refurbish phone chat amazon told handl seller suppos call provid repaid label return discus replac phone return polici say return phone two week give refund money anoth two week order differ phone want say final receiv call refund process promptli,dont trust refurbished phone teach exchange ear speaker phone work turn phone speaker phone make phone call try take speakerphone hear marbled voices lot static understand every with word today trying make phone call speakerphone every time pushed one numbers dial number pack made really loud highpitched tone hit side button try shut sound screen went black still making weird highpitched sound ended stopping 3045 seconds annoying finally shut phone completely turn back point able make call speakerphone give never problems like refurbished phone chat amazon told handle seller supposed calling provide repaid label return discuss replacement phone return policy says return phone two weeks give refund money another two weeks order different phone want say finally received call refund processes promptly,0.9984488487243652,NEGATIVE

20,everything OK but the price is still too high compared to a new one with all original accessoires,"IPhone was shipped in two-day delivery. The box inside of a FedEx bag came opened but the FedEx bag itself was untouched, so I presume it was not completely closed before sealing the bag. The phone came with no scratch or sign of usage at all, a screen protector (nice touch) and generic certified usb cable and charger. No earphones as described. Battery life is 100%. So far it looks and works good. Im only a little concerned that it gets quite hot in the back.Im only doing the math and believe $639.99 is still a high price for a refurbished.

21,"Not ""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice""","""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice"" is is a false statement in their add for Amazon. When I received the phone there was a paper inside the box saying not compatible with Sprint or Boost Mobile. I happen to use one of those carriers, and rather then erasing all my info that I already had transferred from my old phone to the new phone and mailing the phone back I chose to switch carriers which was an additional pain.

43,Selling the last of faulty devices,"Certified. Refurbished. Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right?

47,"Switch from Android flagships to this, and happily surprised.","I got this when the battery life in my last phone, the LG V30 started tanking. I figured that I could easily try the current iPhone and sell it again if I didn't like it. I am pleasantly surprised by pretty much everything this phone offers.I'm going to start with the battery life, because that is the because surprise I have had coming to this phone. On day one with my old phone, I would get at max 6 hours of SoT (screen on time) before the phone would die. That was typically enough for me to go from 6am to 10pm with enough left over for me to not feel worried about dying in the middle of the day. Prior to buying this phone that battery life dropped to roughly 3.5-4 hours of SoT before dying.This new (refurbished I know) phone easily gets ~8 hours of SoT, easily going even higher depending on what I'm doing. I can go a full two days without a charge. That's with bluetooth on 24/7. To say I am happy with the battery is an understatement.The other features, are also pretty good. Not anything that blows me out of the water, but definitely at least as good as the other competition. The face unlock, which I assumed was going to be terrible, is much better than I expected. I would still prefer a fast fingerprint sensor, but this thing does the job almost as well. I have had a few instances where it refuses to recognize me on the first attempt, but they are uncommon. The camera is as good as you would expect from a modern smartphone, with several extra features that are actually useful in certain circumstances.Long story short: I will definitely be sticking with this phone for the foreseeable future.",got batteri life last phone ll ve start take figur could easili tri current phone sell didn like pleasantli surpris pretti much everyth phone offer go start batteri life surpris come phone day one old phone would get max 6 hour sot screen time phone would die typic enough go am pm enough left feel worri die middl day prior buy phone batteri life drop roughli 354 hour sot dyingthi new refurbish know phone easili get 8 hour sot easili go even higher depend in go full two day without charg that bluetooth 247 say happi batteri understatementth featur also pretti good anyth blow water definit least good competit face clock assum go terribl much better expect would still prefer fast fingerprint senior thing job almost well instanc refus recogn first attempt uncommon camera good would expect modern smartphon sever extra featur actual use certain circumstanceslong stori short definit stick phone forese futur,got battery life last phone ll ve started taking figured could easily try current phone sell didn like pleasantly surprised pretty much everything phone offers going start battery life surprise coming phone day one old phone would get max 6 hours sot screen time phone would die typically enough go am pm enough left feel worried dying middle day prior buying phone battery life dropped roughly 354 hours sot dyingthis new refurbished know phone easily gets 8 hours sot easily going even higher depending in go full two days without charge that bluetooth 247 say happy battery understatementthe features also pretty good anything blows water definitely least good competition face clock assumed going terrible much better expected would still prefer fast fingerprint senior thing job almost well instances refuses recognize first attempt uncommon camera good would expect modern smartphone several extra features actually useful certain circumstanceslong story short definitely sticking phone foreseeable future,0.9973129630088806,NEGATIVE

50,Very visibly used and not worth the $100 price difference compared to a new phone,"This review is based on the renewed status of the phone and not of the iPhone itself. I had previously purchased a renewed Galaxy phone from Amazon and the phone was practically new for a small fraction of the price and it came with the original box and accessories. I thought it'd be worth it to save $100 or more since my last experience went so well. Unfortunately, the iPhone I received was very visibly used with scratches littering both sides of the phone, but without deep cracks to the screen. The battery's health was on the lower side. The phone also came in a generic box with generic accessories, which was to be expected since it is in the item description, but when you look at what you get for the renewed price it seems like a poor deal.

I could answer the phone & people could hear me but I couldn‚Äôt hear them, Then shortly after being on the phone it would hang up & say call failed.

62,"Okay quality, a few complaints.","It came in perfect condition, no scratches, nothing was wrong. The battery life was at 100 percent. I had no complaints. One thing I noticed was that the app snapchat is glitchy on the phone. If you try to edit something for your story it just discards it after 30 seconds. Other than that,  it didn't come with earphones. As most people know the Iphone 11 has no headphone jack. So it's crucial that when we buy these phones we should get everything like new. Also, the charger is probably only a foot long. I like to play games or change my music while i'm laying down. I can't do that because the charger is so short. Last but not least, when you get the phone, the instructions are horrible. It tells you to download an app and what not, that just glitches your phone. Don't do it. Instead look up a video online on how to insert a sim card into an Iphone. From there, when you turn on the phone it will have instructions set up from apple. Do not! I repeat do not! Use the instructions provided. If you are switching from android to apple, it will take you longer to set up your phone because you need an apple ID. Also, you need to save your contacts, and write them down. Even after saving all my contacts to my sim card, when I inserted it, none were there.

64,I had high hopes,"I requested an exchange because the phone I got reset on me a few times while trying to set it up. Like I had to redo adding my wifi and password, all the settings like country, prompts, etc. They made the return process so easy so I‚Äôll give them props for that! Just got the ‚Äúexchange‚Äù item. IT‚ÄôS THE SAME EXACT PHONE I SENT BACK! I know because I recognize the small set of scuffs in the top right hand corner. They asked if I wanted the same color and I specified if it was available or I‚Äôd even take a white if it was a better option. They just replaced the little back sticker that came off when I had to clean it the first time I received it because it arrived dirty( like how phones get when they‚Äôve been on a case for a while and the random dust/gunk that kind of accumulates) and added a fancy gold charging cord instead of the play white one.

This whole experience was tragic. The phone was an absolute complete and total piece of worthless junk. The key board didn't work, it constantly froze up, it muted itself whenever it felt like it. I initiated a return process after the hassle of importing everything onto it then having to reverse the process when I realized the phone was possessed. I contacted the company and their big solution was to have me take the phone to a local repair shop like it was a pair of shoes and get an estimate for repairs, send them said estimate and they would then reimburse for the repair cost if the estimate was to their liking.NO WAY!! Ludacris, absurd solution! I finally had to get Amazon customer service involved, 6 phone calls over the span of a week and they were nice about it but I had to drive the phone 45 minutes to a UPS drop off spot after that and finally got a refund but not for the full price paid so I had to call Amazon AGIAN to get it fully rectified. Even the Amazon representative said this was a totally bogus response and proposed solution from the seller and to not buy 3rd party seller items in future. Lesson learned! Don't waste your time with this company. they sell you junk and make it as hard as possible to return for a refund. one month out and I still don't have a phone.

I also love the green color and am glad it came with a screen protector already on it.Knowing this was a used phone, I wasn‚Äôt expecting perfection. However, the screen has two small gouge-like scratches, which is annoying because I can tell this screen is a third-party, cheaper replacement, as it‚Äôs backlight is more yellow than the XR screen.

Battery health is at 84%, but still lasted longer today than the XR battery with a health of 88% (and under heavier use as I played YT music most of the day).

146,"If purchased from CPRTX, return inmediately and pray you don't get stolen.","I don't usually write bad reviews, specially ones that focus on the seller and not the product but I feel it's important for all of you to know my story.I purchased the Red 128GB iPhone 11 from CPRTX. The phone was barely used, inside an office but it was a needed line. A screen protector and cover were installed as the phone was being setup.Over a month of use, the screen started playing games. It would show random patterns or freeze but given that there were updates in between those days, I thought it had to do with updates. However, the issues would continue to happen more and more often and lasting longer so I decided to return, since it was obvious the screen was faulty.CPRTX decided the only thing they needed to return was 72 cents out of the $564 of the phone. Despite being covered by the A to Z Amazon Guarantee, I'm still fighting for my refund - and hope I don't get $565 stolen from them. They keep saying I damaged the phone but their own pictures show a pristine, perfect screen, except when turned on.Otherwise, the iPhone 11 was impeccable. You could tell they did some work by looking at the screws at the bottom but other than that, beautiful. The screen did not seem original but it was working great and so was everything else. You could not believe someone had used that phone before which confirms that there are people out there, like myself, who take really good care of their devices.iOS 14.6 works great in the iPhone 11 and the camera does a better job than the iPhone 6 Plus it replaced. You will also enjoy the added screen size (if you're coming from any of the iPhone Pluses) despite having a smaller device. I do miss TouchID and you will too. Overall, iPhone 11, a great phone. CPRTX - Thieves!So a big warning. Do not trust this (CPRTX) seller. They will do everything in their power to steal from you and do not care if the ship to you a faulty phone.

159,It‚Äôs alright .,"I got this phone earlier than the estimated time which was nice cause I really needed a new phone. Everything works fine, was refurbished gr8tly. However, the whole purpose of looking for a phone was to make sure it was unlocked through any carrier. I go through boost and it‚Äôs hard to get phones under boost so I normally look for unlocked phones. It says it‚Äôs unlocked in packaging and on here‚Ä¶ I began the activation process ‚Ä¶ and it wouldn‚Äôt not let me I looked further and went to setting and under SIM card it said it was locked!!!! It‚Äôs disappointing because I have to go through so much to get it unlocked and now I can‚Äôt even use the phone until then !!! The product was promoted as unlocked as well as the paper work that came with the phone! It‚Äôs just frustrating because I rely on my phone a lot. And to not have one is such an inconvenience especially after I paid for it to be unlocked which might not only cost me out of pocket but my time. I might as well have bought a phone from my carrier.
